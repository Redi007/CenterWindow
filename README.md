# CenterWindow - AHK 2 Script

## ‚ú® Description

This AutoHotkey script centers windows on their respective monitors. It provides two key functions:

Centering the Active Window: `Win + C`

Centering All Visible Windows: `Win + Alt + C`

This script is particularly useful for multi-monitor setups to efficiently organize your workspace.

### Autostart Setup

To ensure the script runs automatically at Windows startup, follow these steps:

1. **Press `Win + R`**, type `%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`, and press `Enter`.
2. Create a shortcut to the path where `CenterWindow.ahk` is saved.
